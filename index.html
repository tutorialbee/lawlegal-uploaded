    <h1 style="font-size: 2rem; line-height: normal;">Right to Life of Article 21  Embraces Precarious Health Condition of an Undertrial </h1>
    <br>
    <p>The detenu, Sidhique Kappan is a journalist and his associates were arrested by U.P Police on 05.10.2020 at 16:50 hrs, while going to Hathras (U.P.) to report gruesome case of rape and murder of a young girl. 
    </p>
    <br />
    <p> In the Habeas Corpus Writ Petition filed by the KERALA UNION OF WORKING JOURNALISTS had prayed that the detenu and his associates were taken to illegal custody on 05.10.2020 ar 16:50 hrs without serving any notice or order as envisaged under section 107 of CrPC by U.P. Police. </p><br />
    <p>The State of U.P files the counter affidavit and supplementary affidavit states that the alleged detenu has been lawfully arrested under Section 107/151 Cr.P.C. and thereafter Police Station Manth District Mathura has registered the FIR No. 199/2020 dated 07.10.2020 under Sections 153A, 295A and 124A of the Indian Penal Code, Section 17, 14 of Unlawful Activity prevention Act, 1967 and Sections 65, 72, 76 of Information Technology Act, 2008.</p><br />
    <p>Based the direction issued by the Supreme Court, the State of U.P. has submitted Medical Reports of the detenu. Further the report reveals that the detenu is having multiple health issues like diabetes, heart ailment, blood pressure, and bodily injury.   </p>

    <br>
    <p>Accordingly, the  Supreme Court states that it is not called to examine detailed facts on merits.  The alleged detenu has got alternative remedies including the right to approach the competent
      court for the grant of bail and/or the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and/or
      under Section 482 Cr.P.C for
      redressal of his grievances. Still further, it may also be relevant to
      note that the co-accused of the alleged detenu have already adopted such a recourse and sought their bail before the Competent Court.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The Learned Solicitor General Tushar Mehta has empassized that adequate medical treatment is being provided as in the case of all other jail inmates and if need be further facility shall be extended to the detenu. </p>
      <br>
      <p>The Apex court commeted that by considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, the Right to life of Article 21 unconditionally embraces even an undertial. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Further Supreme Court states that merely because the other jail inmates are receiving treatment similar to the arrestee/detenu need not deter us.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The Supreme Court held that owing to the apparent
precarious health condition of the arrestee, it is necessary to provide adequate and effective medical assistance to him and to allay all apprehension relating to his health, it would be in the interest of justice to shift Sidhique Kappan either to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital â€“ the arrestee, or to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) or any other Government Hospital in Delhi for the proper medical treatment. The needful shall in this regard be done at the earliest.

          <h1 style="font-size: 2rem; line-height: normal; ">  "Stop-Payment" of cheque was requested by drawer - Is it an offence or not under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act?
          </h1>
          <p> Whether the Stop Payment of Cheque is an offence or not? </p>
          <p>
            The Stop-Payment of Cheque can be requested only when the cheque is lost or missing or any other reasons which should not have the enforceable in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability.
            The N.I. Act is silent as far as the Stop-Payment is concern. There is no explicit provision deals with Stop Payment of Cheque. 

            The Section 139 of Negotiable Instrument Act 1881 gives presumption in favour of holder that it shall be presumed that the holder of a cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in section 138 for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability unless the contrary is proved. 

            But most of the time drawer request stop payment of cheque in order to escape from the enforceable in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability. 

            For the presumption of the section 139 of N.I. Act required ingredients : 

            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>If there is probable defence on behalf of the accused,
                thereafter the burden shifts on the complainant to prove his
                financial capacity and other facts.</li>
              <li></li>
              <li></li>
              <li></li>
              <li></li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            
            Although stopped payment of cheque does not attract an offence under section 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act -1881. In general the stopped payment of Cheque does not come under the umbrella of section 138 of N.I. Act  But there are judgments held the stopped payment of cheque as an offence under the section 138 by virtue of section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. That is from the circumstances of the case, the Court has to draw a presumption that the holder of the cheque received the cheque for discharge of a enforceable debt or liability until the contrary is proved.
            
            In the matter of MMTC Limited Vs Medical Chemicals, Supreme Court held even when the cheque is dishonored by reason of stopped-payment of Cheque, by virtue of Section 139 of N.I. Act, the court has power to presume that the cheque was received by the holder for the discharge of enforceable in whole or in part, of any debt or liability. 
            
            The accused can thus show that the "stop payment" instructions were not issued because of insufficiency or paucity of funds. If the accused shows that in his account there was sufficient funds to clear the amount of the cheque at the time of presentation of the cheque for encashment at the drawer bank and that the stop payment notice had been issued because of other valid causes including that there was no existing debt or liability at the time of presentation of cheque for encashment, then an offence under Section 138 would not be made out. 
            
             
            
            the onus would beupon the accused to rebut the presumption and for that, theaccused has to lead the evidence.It is submitted that the presumptionmandatory by Section 139 of the N.I. Act includes the presumptionthat there exists a legally enforceable debt or liability and thereforeboth the Courts below have materially erred in acquitting theaccused. 
            
            decisions of this Court in the case of Rangappa vs. Sri Mohan,(2010) 11 SCC 441 and Kisan Rao vs. Shankargouda, (2018) 8SCC 165. 
            
            The important thing is that the burden of so proving would be on the accused. Thus a Court cannot quash a complaint on this ground.</p>
